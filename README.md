# Power It Up
This is my custom battery charging station that can charge up to 8 batteries at once!
It uses TP4056 and switches for each 5V power supply and battery holders
I'm building it on a veroboard because its wayy eassy  and I can modify stuff later to add more slots

## What Does It Do??
It charges 8 18650 batteries all at once each with TP4056 
Each slot has its own power switch so I can turn off any battery when I want
Its organized, not messy like random wires everywhere  because of the PCB

## Why vero board?
Its a very simple pcb and making it on vero board ismuch better then purchasing the pcb

## Why Did I Make It?
Because I always need charged batteries for my other projects which have like no charging or 2s or 3s
So I made my own that works better
